            Our mission statement is to inspire others to come together by Bike <br><br>

            Our store was founded in 1969 by the bike Lord himself Bob Shnuesenfults. <br> 
            He started out as a very poor man in Africa who was sad. But then he discovered biking and moved to Antarctica to sell and fix bikes. <br> 
            Now, people come from all over the world to buy Bobs bikes!
